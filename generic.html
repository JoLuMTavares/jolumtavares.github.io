                    <h2 style="text-align: center">About Programming</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center">Thinking again about this subject. There is history. There are tutorials. There are projects. There is evolution. There are multiple ways, since this universe is so large.</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
                            <h3>Commence</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify">It starts just like any other area. First the very basic notions. Then it evolves. It becomes interesting. Then it gets harder. Not easy anymore. The challenges start to get heavier. Here comes the importance of working with a team. Two heads always have a better performance than one. Of course, there is also a great part of Mathematics. The same happens with Physics. All of these result in a very strong knowledge. But that‘ s not all. We can also chose our own path. Maybe we like more the graphic computing. Maybe it is more about networks. Others like databases rather then the Algorithms. But there‘ s also the Artificial Intelligence, which joins all the others. All the concepts together in one. The ability to create wonders.</p>

                        <div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
                            <h3>Not everything is great</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify">And yes. It is exhaustive. It‘ s many times stressful. It‘ s best when a person really loves this. However, it‘s possible to achieve good results without loving it. But then it is the same as we doing a job we don‘t like. It won‘t matter if we are the best employee of the month. We will just want to change as soon as possible. Make no mistake. Loving it does not make it easier. But we are able to better accept failures. Because we believe there’s always a way. There is, indeed, always a way to fix errors, bugs, exceptions.</p>

                            <h3>The way we are</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify">Programming also changes us. That’s right. We may not notice any difference at the beginning. But as time goes, we speak more in a byte way, instead of using our normal emotional. Speaking of bytes, these days we have the Quantum computing. The possibility of one single bit assume 0 and 1 instantly and multiple times. How astonishing is that? What is yet to come in the future? This is such a global impact awaiting to become permanent among all of us.</p>

                            <h3>At the end</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify">Who knows what is yet to come. The robots are getting better. We have the bio-mechanics giving excellent mobility for those with accessibility difficulties. Real intelligent vehicles will start to live with us. The medical operations are more efficient. Our communication is by far faster than many decades ago. We see the programs everywhere. The conclusion can only be one. Programming is also a way of life.</p>
